      <h4>Current state of profits</h4>
	    <p>All of the Alpha Centauri`s money is currently being traded in the 
		personal name of the Manager. Taxes are being paid on profits by the 
		Manager, 3% trading income tax + 10% obligatory tax for health insurance. 
		Hence, all the money and profits in the are clean.</p>
    </div>		
	
	<div id="index-div-box">
	  <h4>Income tax - Romania</h4>
	    <p>Alpha Centauri is based in Romania, where it pays taxes.<p>
		<p>Since 2024, income tax for trading activity was reduced to 
		3% of profit per position profit.</p>
		<p>Another 10% of total profit has to be paid to the national 
		health system if the annual profit exceeds 6 minimum salaries.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="index-div-box">
	  <h4>Income tax - Croatia</h4>
	    <p>-- To be filled --

	<div id="index-div-box">
	    <h4>Current mode on Investors renumeration</h4>
	        <p>It is advisable that Investors re-invest their earned quarterly 
			rate. The Manager keeps orderly record of all shareholders and their 
			dues. Withdrawals of principals or quarterly rates can be done either 
			through personal bank transfer from the Manager`s account, or through 
			cash payments. Sums of money in question (less than 3000 EUR) are 
			not supposed to trigger any additional taxation.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="index-div-box">
	    <h4>Next development step</h4>
    	  <p>When the running profit of the Fund will justify hiring an accounting 
		  professional, a limited liability company will be established and current 
		  Investors will be enrolled as constituting partners with their share 
		  proportional to the invested funds relative to the total size of the 
		  Fund. From there onwards, quarterly payments will be qualified as dividends.
		  </p>
    </div>
	
	<div id="index-div-box">
	  <h4>Constituting shareholders</h4>
	    <p>When starting a limited liability company, an expert will be called 
		in to provide consultancy of legal qualification of the activity of the 
		company and handling of the Investors` money in order for them to be 
		able to withdraw the principal at a future point should they wish to do 
		so</p>
	</div>
		  
	  <div id="index-div-box">
	    <h4>Endgame</h4>
    	  <p>A dividend distributed by a private company to its shareholders is a 
		  common and regulated issue. The company may make a quarterly assessment of 
		  its profits and decide on the dividend amount. Each investor should consult 
		  the legislation of his/her country regarding receiving dividends, but this 
		  is usually clear. Inter-state agreements between Romania and Croatia are 
		  in place to avoid excessive taxation of both countries.</p>
