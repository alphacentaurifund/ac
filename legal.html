	  <h4>Status of investment/trading</h4>
	    <p>In Romania, investment and trading activity is considered as independent 
		activity. No corporate structure is required for this, however, the 
		realized net profit is subject to income tax, depending in which bracket 
		the profit falls</p>
	</div>
		
	<div id="legal-div-box">
	  <h4>Income tax - Romania</h4>
	    <p>The Manager is based in Romania, where he pays taxes.
		Since 2024, income tax for trading activity was reduced to 
		3% of profit per position profit. Appreciation of gold holdings is not 
		taxable.
		Another amount, up to 10% of total profit has to be paid annually to the 
		national health system.</p>
	</div>
	
	

    <div id="legal-div-box">
	  <h4>The broker</h4>
	    <p>Some investment instruments cannot be accessed directly by theFund 
		Manager. In such cases, an intermediary company, called the broker, 
		has to be used to connect investors with financial markers. Alpha 
		Centauri uses the broker XTB, Romanian section.</p>
    </div>
	
	<div id="legal-div-box">
	  <h4>Legal treatment of Investor deposits</h4>
	    <p>At this stage, the relationship between the Investor  
		and the Manager is resolved through spoken lending 
		agreements. If required, the nominal re-payment date may be specified. 
		Upon withdrawal, the Fund returns the entire principal amount, and the 
		accumulated interest in a separate transaction.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="legal-div-box">
	  <h4>Incorporation stage</h4>
	    <p>Planned transformation of the Fund into a registered investment company 
		is planned for end of 2026 or beginning of 2027. In this case, a new set of 
		legal provisions will apply, and the Investors will be informed in due time. 
		A most likely scenario would be a Limited Liability Company with Investors as 
		becoming shareholders and interest rates converted to dividends.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="legal-div-box">
	  <h4>Long-term vision</h4>
	    <p>Alpha Centauri is supposed to become in a few years a company with well 
		diversified investments and considerable cash flow, that will be a source of 
		supplementary income for all Investors. A best case scenario is that this 
		income becomes so large that Investors could live off it alone.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="legal-div-box">
	  <h4>Contact and info</h4>
	    <p>For any specific questions about legal and tax issues and Fund 
		strategy, please do not 
		hesitate to contact the Manager. If he does not the answer right away, he has 
		contacts whom to ask for up-to-date information.</p>
	</div>
	

		  

	</div>
	
	<div id="legal-div-box">
	  <h4>Life-long learning</h4>
	    <p>At this point the Fund functions smoothly like a well-oiled machine, and 
		corporate obligations are well studied. Nevertheless, the Manager remains 
		committed to continuous studying of the situation on the markets in order to 
		remain profitable and continue delivering generous profits for the Investors.
