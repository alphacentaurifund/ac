	    <p><b>There are rules and legislation that are relevand to different 
		development stages of the Fund. It is important to know and respect 
		them to avoid clashes with governments, which are always stronger.</b></p>


    <h4>Intense learning phase (Jan 2023 - Dec 2024)</h4>
  
    <div id="index-div-box">
      <h4>Current state of profits</h4>
	    <p>All of the Alpha Centauri`s money is currently being traded in the 
		personal name of the Manager. Taxes are being paid on profits by the 
		Manager, 3% trading income tax + 10% obligatory tax for health insurance. 
		Hence, all the money and profits in the are clean.</p>
    </div>		
	
	<div id="index-div-box">
	  <h4>Status of investment/trading</h4>
	    <p>In Romania, investment and trading activity is considered as independent 
		activity, similar to renting out own real estate and authorised specialist 
		businesses. No corporate structure is required for this, however, the 
		investors must report the income on annually through a dedicated form and 
		pay taxes depending on the realised income bracket.</p>
	</div>
		
	<div id="index-div-box">
	  <h4>Income tax - Romania</h4>
	    <p>The Manager is based in Romania, where he pays taxes.<p>
		<p>Since 2024, income tax for trading activity was reduced to 
		3% of profit per position profit.</p>
		<p>Another 10% of total profit has to be paid to the national 
		health system if the annual profit exceeds 6 minimum salaries.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="index-div-box">
	  <h4>The broker</h4>
	    <p>The broker used by the Fund is XTB branch Romania. Natural persons and 
		small companies cannot participate directly on the 
		stock and commodity markets, due to costs and barriers to entry. Hence, a 
		broker is a necessary intermediary which receives orders from clients and 
		sends them further to the market hubs.</p>
    </div>
	
	
	<h4>Investor Programme (started Aug 2024)</h4>
	
	<div id="index-div-box">
	  <h4>Deposits: legal considerations - Croatia</h4>
	    <p>At this stage, the relationship between the Investor who lends the money 
		and the Manager wko receives the money is resolved through spoken lending 
		agreements. The principal is lended to the Manager, and upon withdrawal 
		Investors receive the same principal amount and the accummulated interest 
		in another transaction as gift, so no tax is owed. The Manager will 
		provide more info upon request.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="index-div-box">
	  <h4>Deposits: legal considerations - Romania</h4>
	    <p>At this stage, Investor deposits to Alpha Centauri are 
		made through lending to the Manager. If the Investor insists 
		on a formal relationship, the Romanian law item "Lending 
		Contract (Contract de Imprumut)" shall be established. More 
		info on this issue 
		<a href="https://candealawoffice.ro/articole/contractul-de-imprumut/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
	</div>
	

	
	<h4>Incorporation (estimated end-2026)</h4>

	<div id="index-div-box">
	    <h4>Next development step</h4>
    	  <p>When the running profit of the Fund will justify hiring an accounting 
		  professional, a limited liability company will be established and current 
		  Investors will be enrolled as constituting partners with their share 
		  proportional to the invested funds relative to the total size of the 
		  Fund. From there onwards, quarterly payments will be qualified as dividends.
		  </p>
    </div>
	
	<div id="index-div-box">
	  <h4>Constituting shareholders</h4>
	    <p>When starting a limited liability company, an expert will be called 
		in to provide consultancy of legal qualification of the activity of the 
		company and handling of the Investors` money in order for them to be 
		able to withdraw the principal at a future point should they wish to do 
		so</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="index-div-box">
	  <h4>Government grabs from companies</h4>
	    <p>In Romania, at this moment, the tax on profits for companies in financial 
		sector is 16 %. The percentage may vary depending on the mood of the government. 
		In any case this is not a significant increase from 13 % which the Manager 
		pays now.</p>
	</div>
		  
	  <div id="index-div-box">
	    <h4>Dividend</h4>
    	  <p>A dividend distributed by a private company to its shareholders is a 
		  common and regulated issue. The company may make a quarterly assessment of 
		  its profits and decide on the dividend amount. Alpha Centauri will henceforth 
		  continue with renumeration of its Investors through dividends. Taxation of 
		  dividends is described in each country`s tax law. Intergovernmental agreements 
		  on avoiding of double taxation should prevent taxation of dividends two times, 
		  both in the country of origin and the country of recipients.</p>
		  </p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="index-div-box">
	  <h4>Life-long learning</h4>
	    <p>At this point the Fund functions smoothly like a well-oiled machine, and 
		corporate obligations are well studied. Nevertheless, the Manager remains 
		committed to continuous studying of the situation on the markets in order to 
		remain profitable and continue delivering generous profits for the Investors.
