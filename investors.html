      <h4><b>For Investors</b><h4>
	  
	  <p>The Investors Programme of Alpha Centauri was launched in August 2024 
	  and will run until the conversion of the Fund into a Limited Liability 
	  Company.</p>
	  <p>Main details about the Investor Programme can be found below, while a full 
	  normative document on relationships with Investors can be downloaded 
	  <a href="investors/ac-normative-investors-relationships.pdf" target="_blan">here</a></p>
	  
  		<div id="index-div-box">
		  <h4>Interest rate</h4>
		    <p>Annualized interest rate to Investors is 12%.</p>
			<p>A 3% interest rate is accorded each 3 months, and compounding.</p>
			<p>The Manager can discretionally accord sign-up bonuses or one-time 
			bonuses following exceptionally good trading profits.</p>
		</div>

      <div id="index-div-box">
	    <h4>Deposit</h4>
		  <p>The Fund accepts new investors by the invitation from the Manager 
		  or by a strong recommendation from an existing Investor</p>
		  <p>The Fund collects deposits at bank accounts in Erste bank Romania 
		  or Revolut Bank (Lithuania). Accounts in EUR and USD are active.</p>
		  <p>Please contact the Manager about deposit details.</P>
	  </div>
		
		<div id="index-div-box">
		  <h4>Contributions record</h4>
		    <p>The Manager keeps a detailed record of all contributions, including 
			dates, bank accounts, currencies and amounts.</p>
			<p>Investors can at any moment request a statement document of their 
			contributions and interest amounts accummulated hitherto.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div id="index-div-box">
		  <h4>Withdrawals</h4>
		    <p>Investors have the right to partial or complete withdrawal 
			of their contributions and interest at any time.</p>
		</div>
		

		
		<div id="index-div-box">
		  <h4>Cybersecurity</h4>
		    <p>Alpha Centauri does not take safety in online spaces 
			lightly. Hence, all devices used to log in into trading 
			and banking services are secured with full versions of 
			VPN and antivirus software. Subscriptions are paid 
			annually from the profits and do not affect Investors</p>

		  <h4>Market-wide events</h4>
		    <p>Below are some of the biggest market-moving events from the recent 
			past. Since the Investors in Alpha Centauri receive a fixed interest 
			rate these events do not have an immediate impact. Nevertheless, the 
			investors may still have felt these effects if they have other 
			investments elsewhere.</p>
		  
		  
		  <div id="event-box">
		    <table>
			  <th>Yen carry trade unwinding</th>
			  <tr>
			  <td>
			    <p><b>Aug 2024</b></p>
