  <h3>Macroeconomic environment of Alpha Centauri</h3>
  <h5>This page explains in brief the most important economic factors that have an effect either <br>on the 
  Fund in general, or individual Investors depending where they are located.</h5>
  
  
      <div id="country">
	    <h4>Romania</h4>
		
		  	  <img src="curs/bnr.png" alt="Romanian National Bank" style="float:right" width="400px" height="auto">

		  <p>Romanian government runs a budget deficit of around 8%. Furthermore, 
		  the coupons on governmental bonds, both in domestic currency RON and in 
		  EUR have incremental tendency.<p>
		  <p>These issues support the thesis of depreciating domestic currency 
		  against EUR, and byextension, USD. The presidential elections of 2025 
		  introduced political risks as a nationalist candidate gained significant 
		  support.</p>
		  <p>Investors in Alpha Centauri are protected from depreciation of domestic 
		  currency RON, because the interest rate is accorded in USD.</p>
		  <p>Gold reserves of the Fund will also appreciate relative to domestic 
		  currency. In fact, the Fund Manager himself receives salary in RON, but he 
		  strives to convert RON either into gold or foreing currency as soon as 
		  possible.</p>

	    <h4>The United States of Americe</h4>
		
		  <img src="curs/fed.png" alt="The Federal Reserve Bank" style="float:right" width="400px" height="auto">
		
		  <p>USA businesses will continue to do well. However, the main structural 
		  issue is the cronical, structural deficit that US government runs. After WWII, 
		  USA started abandoning principles of budget soundness in the name of accelerated 
		  economic growth.</P>
		  <p>The promise of economic, technological and military supremacy led to 
		  astronomic inflow of foreign capital into USA. Furthermore, the US Dollar 
		  being the reserve currency of the World created conditions where the USA 
		  is indeed the economic powerhouse of the World.</p>
		  <p>However, this status can not be taken as granted, as we have seen the 
		  recent actions of president Trump reversing the capital flows out of USA. 
		  Despite bad policies, the US Dollar is not going to disappear and USA will 
		  do well, but it may not continue to attract capital from all over the World.</p>
		  <p>Ralevant to Alpha Centauri is the oscilation of US Dollar strength (DXT). 
		  It is a measure of relative strength of the dollar towards six other major 
		  currencies. The DXY has a cyclical nature, but its position will partially have 
		  effect on strategic decisions of the Fund</p>

	  <h4>Croatia</h4>
	  
	      <img src="curs/hnb.png" alt="Croatian National Bank" style="float:right" width="400px" height="auto">
	  
	  <p>Croatia has done a lot to stabilize its finances, and reduce the national deby and budget deficit 
	  since joining the EU in 2013.In January 2023 Croatia adopted tue euro to replace its national currency, 
	  the Croatian Kuna (HRK), which facilitated transactions with other eurozone countries and eliminated the 
	  need for the Central bank to keep stabilizing the exchange rake HRK/EUR.</p>
	  <p>Having the euro as the currency, Croatian monetary policy is determinated by the European central 
	  bank (ECB).</p>
	  <p>Thus, for the Investors in Alpha Centauri the exchange rate EUR/USD set by ECB is the most relevant 
	  factor. The exchange rate usually fluctuates between 0.95 and 1.15 EUR/USD, and the fluctuation of 
	  the rate may present arbitrage opportunities when larger sums are in play.</p>
