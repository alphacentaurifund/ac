	  <h4>Profits</h4>
	    <p>Considering current account size and risk management strategy, it 
		is expected that the trading account will bring a monthly profit of 
		600 +/- 200 USD.</p>
		<p>However, the Fund also has its running expenses, distributions and 
		annual fees, so the amount above cannot be taken for granted.</p>

      <h4><b>Principles of operation</b><h4>
	  
	  <br>
	    <p>Alpha Centauri has two main components: the trading 
		account and the reserves. Parameters of the trading account 
		are disclosed to the Investors, while the content of 
		reserves is presented just as aggregate fraction.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>The trading account is the "work horse" of the Fund, and 
		it is through its activity where profits are made. Reserves 
		can be physical gold, cash in other currencies, or other 
		assets that retain their value at the moment.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>The Manager will balance the trading account size and 
		the reserves. Reserves, although necessary, should not take 
		up resources which could otherwise contribute to the profit-
		making trading account.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>New money coming as Investor contributions will go straigh 
		into the trading account to increase its benchmark size.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>Both the money of the Manager and of the Investors is 
		combined. Hence, the Manager has an equal interest for the 
		Fund to do well as do the Investors. The stake of the 
		Manager is actually higher because he has more money in 
		total in the Fund.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>Alpha Centauri is currently trading prices of silver. 
		According to credible sources of information, this commodity 
		has predictable supply and demand dynamics, and it has a 
		robust demand by investors. Regarding the Fund`s method of 
		profit production, it is not so important where the price is 
		at at the moment, but rather if it can be traded. Silver price 
		has a long-term growth trajectory, and it is volatile enough 
		on a daly basis to bring running profits.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>The Manager will keep to the words written here in order 
		to keep the stability of operations, otherwise it would be 
		like gambling for Investors. Nevertheless, the Manager retains 
		the right to modify the general trading target if the 
		macroeconomic conditions change.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>Like every undertaking, the performance of Alpha Centauri 
		will inevitably have a wave pattern. During good times 
		the Manager will accummulate reserves, 
		and during hard times he will dose these reserves 
		into the trading account to ensure its continuous operation.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>The Fund aims to bring in constant stream of profits and 
		achieve a steady growth. At the moment the strategy consists 
		of taking small positions at financial instruments and taking 
		profits after change in its price.  As the 
		Fund grows, other types of more robust strategies will be 
		explored. It is the economy of scale - the more you have, 
		the more you can take.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>The Fund is at the moment a private project. The Investors 
		are encouraged to re-invest earned interest instead of withdrawing it, until 
		a corporate structure of the Fund can be established. This will 
		probably come in a year or two, when the running profits will 
		justify taking in an accounting professional (check the tab 
		"Legal and Strategy".</p>
