  <h3>Fund operation and strategy</h3>
  <h5>This page presents what Alpha Centauri invests in, and what is the fund management strategy.</h5>
  
  <br>
  <h4>Strategic investing and trading</h4>
  
  
	<div id="strategy-div-box">
	  <h4>Fund structure</h4>
	    <p>The new Fund structure comprising three components allows for 
		meaningful diversification of income streams and compartmentalization 
		of risks. In this manner the Fund can continuously generate profit, 
		in different economic periods.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="strategy-div-box" class="benchmarking">
	  <h4>Trading account</h4>
	   <p>The trading account is used to generate ultra-short term profits from 
	   changes in gold and silver spot prices. At the moment, these average out 
	   to 500 $ a week.</p>
	</div>
  
    <div id="strategy-div-box">
	  <h4>Physical gold reserves</h4>
	    <p>Holding a substantial portion of wealth in the form of gold is never 
        a bad idea. Gold bars maybe don`t generate profit, however, there is no 
c        no counter-party risk, and it is an excellent hedge against depreciation 
        of any currency.		
		</div>
	
	<div id="principles">
  
      <br>
      <h4><b>General Fund structure</b></h4>
	  
	    <p align="justify">After December 2025 major revision of the strategy, 
		weighing out the current global risks and opportunities 
		the Fund now has three components, as outlined below.</p>
		
		<p><b>Alpha Centauri A (aC A)</b></p>
		<p align="justify">The trading account is the main generator of profit 
        through ultra-short term trades (up to 1 week). 		
		It is currently capped at 10 000 $ for risk management reasons. 
		As the experience and skill of the Manager 
		increases, so does the efficiency of usage of capital. Hence, this 
		amount of money is sufficient for maintenance of steady profit. 
		Any profits 
		above the 10K threshold will be used to fill other components of the 
		Fund.</p>
		
		<p><b>Alpha Centauri B (aC B)</b></p>
		<p align="justify">The 
		Manager has decided to increase gold reserves from earlier 20% to 
		planned about a third. Due to the long-term economic trend of 
		depreciation of paper currencies, gold price is expected to rise in the 
		next years. Ample gold reserves mean that the Fund is "long" gold 
		at all time.</p>
		<br>
		<p><b>Proxima Centauri (Proxima)</b></p>
		<p align="justify">This component is currently being filled. 
		Here the money is directed towards 
		fixed income instruments (governmental bonds).  Proxima currently 
		serves as a relatively safe and slightly growing instrument where money 
		is kept until a good investment opportunity comes along.</p>
		<br>
		
		  <table id="components">
		    <th>Component</th><th>Alpha Centauri A</th><th>Alpha Centauri B</th><th>Proxima</th>

			</tr>
		  </table>
		
		
      <h4><b>Day-to-day operation</b></h4>
		
		<p align="justify">Incoming money from Investors will be used 
		among the Fund components according 
		to the allocation needs of the Fund at that moment, but will be 
		treated as a part of common money pool of entire Fund level. Likewise, 
		any withdrawal of Investors will be considered as coming out of the 
		common money pool, irrespective of status of Fund components.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p align="justify">At the moment, winter 2025, the fund generates 
		profit in aC A component by ultra-short trades on gold and silver 
		spot prices. The generated profit is periodically re-distributed among 
		longer-term investments in aC B and Proxima.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p align="justify">The Manager has concucted, tested and written down 
		several trading strategies that are applicable to gold and silver 
		markets. These tactics each have defined risks and earning potential, 
		and the Manager employs either tactic based on current price action, 
		situation on commodities markets and general sentiment of market 
		participants.</p>
		<br>
		
		      <h4><b>Longer-term outlook</b></h4>
		
		<p align="justify">The Fund targets at least 5% monthly profit, relative 
		to the total Fund size. Inevitably, losing trades will occur, either 
		due to bad decisions or due to change of overall trading strategy. In 
		these cases, the Manager will offset losing positions and close them 
		in a controlled manner so that a stable overall monthly profit is 
		 maintained.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p align="justify">The Manager may take on more credit to boost the 
		trading account size when the conditios are favourable. In this case, 
		it will be imperative that the Fund produces significantly more profit 
		than the monthly refund rate of the credit.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p align="justify">Once the operaitng risks are minimizes and the stability 
		and predictability of profits achieved, the Fund will be incorporated. The 
		most likely scenario is a Limited Liability Company with current Alpha 
		Investors converted to shareholders receiving dividends.</p>

			  Subdivision of the Fund into three components, each with its own 
			  financial instruments and purpose, and without direct money link,

			<td><p>
			  A strong rule is that Fund`s own cash + gold reserves have to be

			 Alpha Centauri does not engage in high-risk activities.

			<td><p>
			  The Manager is at all time alert to emerging and potential risks
